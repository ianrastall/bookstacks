# Bookstacks

Bookstacks is a statically generated reading site for complete books encoded as TEI P5. Each XML file in `tei/` is a standalone work and language edition; related editions are grouped at the work level without assuming chapter-by-chapter alignment.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use `npm run build` for the same type check and static production build used before deployment. The generated site is written to `dist/`.

## Project layout

- `src/` contains the Astro site and TEI-to-HTML reader.
- `public/` contains deployable static assets.
- `tei/` contains the curated standalone TEI corpus, schema, validator, and build scripts.
- `assets/` contains local source material used by the TEI preparation pipeline. It is not served or committed; the deployable standalone results live in `tei/`.

See `tei/README.md` for corpus provenance and validation details.
